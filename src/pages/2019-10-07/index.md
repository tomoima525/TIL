## Estimation, Target, Commitment

- 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch50.html
- An estimate is an approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something. This definition implies that an estimate is a factual measure based on hard data and previous experience—hopes and wishes must be ignored when calculating it. The definition also implies that, being approximate, an estimate cannot be precise, e.g., a development task cannot be estimated to last 234.14 days.

- A target is a statement of a desirable business objective, e.g., “The system must support at least 400 concurrent users.”

- A commitment is a promise to deliver specified functionality at a certain level of quality by a certain date or event. One example could be “The search functionality will be available in the next release of the product.”
- Estimates, targets, and commitments are independent from one another, but targets and commitments should be based on sound estimates.
